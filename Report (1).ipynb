    "**Worldwide experts estimate that people drink about 2.5 billion cups of coffee a day. Sales in the ready-to-drink market which includes coffee shops are forecast to grow by 67% between now and 2022. Thus its a good business idea to open a coffee shop.\n",
    " But obviously its not necessary that a new coffee shop owner will be immediately successful, only because that business has a good growth rate in market .There are several things that he/she needs to consider in order to succeed. Data science can help this person in several ways. One of those is to help him or her to find the best location for opening the coffee shop.**"
